## Starting with java functions

## Methods 

* A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
* Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

```java
static void setData(int[] arr, int len);

```

* <b> static </b> means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.

* static member-function or fields can be accessed directly without creating the object
