# Buffer 
Buffer is memory object which is used for holding the data for some time
to bring in the compatibility between the devices 
If one is slower and other is faster but the entire data should be received 
there , without any loss, for that reason we put the intermediate between two
devices as buffer.
The rate at which data is transferred from the java program and the rate which 
the data is recived at destination end, that speed is different, to ovecome this 
we need buffering.
Buffering is needed, if there is a imcopaibility  of speed in between the devices
